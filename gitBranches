# About Branches

Start with a common base, the initial source for the project. At one point, the code is branched while new features are developed.
both branches can be  undergoing changes. 
When the two streams of work are ready to merge, each branch's code is identified as a tip, and the two tips are merged into a third combined branch.
Developers work on source files in a branch. Commit indicates that the developer is convinced that the code represents a stable platform for the feature or set of features being developed.
 The developer can choose to commit to the current branch or create a new branch.


A pull request makes the proposed committed changes available for others to review and use.
